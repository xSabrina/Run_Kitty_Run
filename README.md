1) How to play
> Control your player with WASD
> Activate ability 1 (Blink) with left mouse, ability 2 (Shoot) with right mouse - there are cooldowns
> Choose the direction of abilities with your mouse
> Avoid enemies with your abilities and get through the levels as fast as you can


2) What to ignore
> Missing/false animations - we are on it ;)
> At the moment, the player can still blink out of the map
> End screen not yet implemented
> "Options" in InGame-Menu still a dummy
